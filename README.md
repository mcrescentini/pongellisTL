Pongelli Traffic Light is an open-source project that replicates the real traffic light system of Pongelli with three stations and two modes: the standard 'Rest of the World' mode and the unique 'Pongelli' mode.



Pongelli Traffic Light is an open-source project that replicates the real traffic light system of Pongelli.
It includes three traffic light stations and offers two operating modes:

Rest of the World – standard traffic light behavior as commonly seen worldwide.
Pongelli Mode – the special traffic light logic inspired by the unique setup in Pongelli.

This project is meant for experimentation, education, and fun, showcasing how local traffic systems can differ from the standard, and should be understood as a sarcastic and satirical project.
